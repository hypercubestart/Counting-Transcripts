[Counting Transcripts](https://github.com/hypercubestart/Counting-Transcripts) is a Jupyter notebook tutorial series for helping introduce the basics of analyzing cell transcriptome and different tools biologists use when looking at gene expression. 

There are four parts of this tutorial:
1. [Introduction](https://github.com/hypercubestart/Counting-Transcripts/blob/master/Counting%20Transcripts%20-%20Introduction.ipynb): setup and basic concepts
2. [Pipeline A](https://github.com/hypercubestart/Counting-Transcripts/blob/master/Counting%20Transcripts%20-%20Pipeline%20A.ipynb): [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic), [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR), [cufflinks](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/) pipeline
3. [Pipeline B](https://github.com/hypercubestart/Counting-Transcripts/blob/master/Counting%20Transcripts%20-%20Pipeline%20B.ipynb): [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic), [kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) pipeline
4. [Extension](https://github.com/hypercubestart/Counting-Transcripts/blob/master/Counting%20Transcripts%20-%20Extension.ipynb): application to a real research paper, analyze differentially expressed transcripts with PCA and t-SNE

This tutorial is built for anybody to freely use and download. No prior knowledge is necessary, but it may be helpful to understand cell biology to easier grasp concepts.
