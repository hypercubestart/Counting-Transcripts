[Transcriptome_Tutorial](https://github.com/hypercubestart/Transcriptome-Tutorial/blob/master/Transcriptome_Tutorial.ipynb) is Jupyter notebook for helping introduce the basics of analyzing cell transcriptome and different tools biologists use when looking at gene expression. 

Starting from raw reads of the transcriptome in sra file format, we cover two pipelines for cleaning, mapping, and quantifying the reads.

1. [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic), [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR), [cufflinks](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/)
2. [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic), [kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/)

We also have an additional extension that uses data from a real experiment to analyze differentially expressed transcripts using graphs.

This tutorial is built for anybody to freely use and download. No prior knowledge is needed, but it may be helpful to understand cell biology to easier grasp concepts.
